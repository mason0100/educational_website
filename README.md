COSC 412 Spring 2019 Project
February 12, 2019
Note: This scenario is fictional.

Background: 
In what can only be called a “revolutionary” business partnership, the Department of Education has teamed up with the Maryland Board of Education, a top international gaming company called Tek Gaming Solutions, and representatives of the state’s amusement parks, for the purpose of devising an engaging, “fun” way to keep middle school-aged children active, outside, learning AND, most important, having fun during their summer breaks.  The DOE and MD Board of Education have determined that an online game would be the ideal solution however they have turned to Tek Gaming Solutions to lead the majority of the project as it is out of their technical areas of expertise.  Representatives for the state’s amusement parks will provide guidance into how to get kids outside and having fun with the game.
